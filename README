When using dspam in conjuction with SpamAssassin and amavisd-new, amavisd-new automatically has dspam calculate the probabability of a message being HAM/SPAM and then insert headers. If you have SA installed, the dspam information goes to waste. That is unless you take advantage of this plugin. Using dspamâ€™s results, this module adds a tag/token to the message that SA picks up and based on the score you assign it in the ruleset configuration file, it adds/subtracts that score.

To use this module, put the perl module in /usr/share/perl5/Mail/SpamAssassin/Plugin/ (or wherever your SA Plugin dir is). Put the config file (dspam.cf) with the rest of the SpamAssassin config files (usually located in /etc/spamassassin). First, edit the local.cf file and add the following line anywhere in the file:

    include dspam.cf

Next, edit the init.pre file and add the following line anywhere near the other lodplugin lines (Note: This should be the Perl @INC path to the location that you put your dspam.pm plugin):

   loadplugin Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::dspam

Then edit the dspam.cf and put your desired values for each of the hits. Start low to see how the response is and watch your logs closely.

I have also found it handy to create METAs that where SA reads a message as BAYES_99 and dspam reads a message as DSPAM_SPAM_99 add a substantial amount of points. The same goes for the reverse, if SA reads a message at BAYES_00 and dspam reads that same message at DSPAM_HAM_99, then subtract a substantial number of points.
